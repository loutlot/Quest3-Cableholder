## Components

The model consists of three parts:

1. **Cable Holder for the Side of the Ears (for Link Cable)**
2. **Cable Holder for the Back of the Head (for Link Cable)**
3. **Apple Earpods Cable Wrap Mount for the Top**

### Functionality

- **Parts 1 and 2**: These components are designed to reversibly hold the cables in place. By attaching the cable holders to the back of the head, they help improve weight balance by applying traction to the cables. These holders are intended for cables approximately 5mm in diameter. The cable shown in the images is the "UGREEN Link Cable."

- **Part 3**: This part securely holds the Apple EarPods to the top of the Quest3, positioning the earbuds so that they align perfectly with your ears. It attaches to the top band of the headset.

### Printing Instructions

The model data is stored in the `/Models` directory in STL format. For printing with an FDM/FFF 3D printer, please orient the model as shown in the attached image.
